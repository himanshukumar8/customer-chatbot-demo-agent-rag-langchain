## NOTES
1. Make sure you use the appropriate environment. You can install modules using `requirements.txt`.
2. If you find an error about OpenAI, it could be that you need to specifcy OpenAI API key. Make a file called `openai_api_key` in `secret` folder and keep your key there.
3. Ollama with Llama3.2-3B should be running. You can set up by:
```shell
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama serve
```
